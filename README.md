# flutter_secure_storage_windows

Highly experimental federated plugin for [flutter_secure_storage] plugin for Windows.

## Status

This is still in heavy development and does not secure the data right now.
Since I cannot detect for the moment which app is calling this plugin all apps will override the data of other apps.

In other words this is **just for testing** right now!
